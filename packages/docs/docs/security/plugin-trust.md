# Plugin trust model

User-installed plugins (loaders, tool plugins, domains) run **in-process with full Python privileges** — they can read your data dir, make outbound network calls, and load arbitrary code.

## Default policy

`CHAOSCYPHER_ALLOW_USER_PLUGINS=1` — user plugins are loaded.

To disable user plugins entirely:

```bash
CHAOSCYPHER_ALLOW_USER_PLUGINS=0 docker compose up -d
```

## What plugins can do

- Read/write `{data-dir}/`.
- Make HTTP requests.
- Import any installed Python package.
- Use the configured LLM providers via Chaos Cypher's wrappers (so they pay the rate limits the operator paid for).

## Where plugins live

- `{data-dir}/plugins/loaders/` — source loaders (run at `*_loader.py` files)
- `{data-dir}/plugins/tools/` — tool plugins (run at `*_plugin.py` files)
- `{data-dir}/plugins/domains/` — domain definitions (`.jsonld` data files)
- `{data-dir}/plugins/cleaners/` — data cleaners (run at `*.py` files)
- `{data-dir}/plugins/archive_handlers/` — archive handlers (run at `*.py` files)

Python files are executed at startup via `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location()` — any top-level code runs immediately.

## Audit trail

Every user plugin file loaded is logged at `WARNING` level with its absolute path and SHA-256 digest. Grep your logs for `user_plugin_loaded` to see what ran.

## Trust posture for self-hosters

You are the only operator. Treat plugins like Python packages: read the code before running it, prefer signed/well-known sources, and disable the loader if you've been handed a `.zip` from somewhere you don't trust.

For a more aggressive isolation story, see the [self-hosted threat model](./self-hosted-threat-model.md).

## Operator checklist for shared deployments

If you're running Chaos Cypher in a multi-user or untrusted environment:

- Run the Chaos Cypher service as a dedicated unprivileged user.
- Set `CHAOSCYPHER_ALLOW_USER_PLUGINS=0` in the service environment.
- Install trusted plugins via pip entry points instead (`chaoscypher.plugins.*` groups); entry-point plugins are subject to the same process privileges but at least route through your package manager and CI.
